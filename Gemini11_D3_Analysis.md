## **Use case Description**

| Use Case Name: Install new subsystems and configuration | ID: 01 | Importance Level: High |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Primary Actor: Support Staff |  | Use Case Type: User Initiated |
| Stakeholders and Interests: **Support Staff**: Responsible for installing new subsystems and ensuring that they integrate correctly with the existing infrastructure. They need a smooth, error-free process to maintain operational stability. **Telescope Operator**: Relies on properly configured subsystems to ensure accurate telescope control and observational operations. **Astronomer**: Needs the installed subsystems to function correctly to support scientific observations and data collection. **Science Observer**: Uses the telescope and its subsystems indirectly and depends on their correct configuration for seamless operation. **Administrators**: Oversee system integrity and may need to approve or review installations for compliance with observatory standards.   |  |  |
| Brief Description: The use case describes the process for installing new subsystems and configuring them for use in operations. The support staff will initiate the installation process after validating the configuration files. The system then makes updates, applies the configuration, and performs diagnostics. Errors are rolled back with a log issue for troubleshooting. When the successful installation process has been verified, the system updates its logs, and support staff confirm that the subsystem is ready.  |  |  |
| Trigger: The support staff initiates the installation process for new subsystems.   Type: User-Initiated |  |  |
| Relationships: 	Association: Support Staff 	Include: File Validation, Installation Execution 	Extend: Error handling, Rollback Process |  |  |
| Normal Flow of Events: The support staff logs into the system. The support staff navigates to the "Subsystem Installation" section. The system displays available installation options. The support staff selects a subsystem and uploads configuration files. The system validates the uploaded files. If files are invalid, an error message is displayed, and staff re-uploads files. If valid, the system proceeds with the installation. The system updates and reconfigures the necessary components. The system confirms successful installation and updates the logs. The support staff verifies system status and logs out.   |  |  |
| Subflows: **1a:** Support staff checks system logs for prior installation history. **2a:** Support staff saves a report of the installation process for future reference.  |  |  |
| Alternate/Exceptional Flow: **AE1:** If the system fails to authenticate the user, access is denied. **AE2:** If an invalid configuration file is uploaded, the system prompts for re-upload. **AE3:** If the installation fails, the system rolls back changes and logs an error.     |  |  |
